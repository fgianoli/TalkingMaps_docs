First of all you need a story to tell. 


..  TIP:: 

    If your story develops in a clear and linear geospatial context it would be better

Once decided your story, you should give it a name (an ID). The ID is very important for TalkingMaps. Assigning an ID will make you able to export correctly the Talking Map.

If you are using our online editor, to add an ID you can simply enter the name in the form and press on Create! button.

..  Note:: 

    The TalkingMapID should follows the Snake_case convention: avoid spaces or special characters.

If you are not using our online editor, to assign an id you can just add, at the end of the address of your server:

\ |STYLE1|\    this command allow you to enter in the edit mode

\ |STYLE2|\   this command allow you to concatenate the commands and start editing a new TalkingMap.
