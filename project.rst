Why?
-----
	
We wanted to create an editor for storymaps that was easy to customize, easy to share and easily integrated with QGIS maps and other web resources, and, obviously, totally Open Source.


Online DEMO

    The TalkingMap is still an alpha version, we are still developing the platform. If you have any suggestion or do you want to help us, please contact us.
