Why?
-----
We are the TenOli team (Martino & Federico), we love maps and web programming and we are OpenSource enthusiastic.
We wanted to create an editor for storymaps that was easy to customize, easy to share and easily integrated with QGIS maps and other web resources, and, obviously, totally Open Source. All this in order to be free to tell our stories whitout any limitations.
